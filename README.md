# Palworlds Config Editor

Do you like hot garbage? Do you want to edit your palworlds config but are too lazy to use notepad like the rest of us? Look no further and just follow the simple guide below.

1. Install NodeJS 16.16.0
2. Clone / Download this terrible creation and place whereever you want.
3. Open the directory in CMD or VS and run ``` npm i ```
4. Copy your PalWorlds config to root of the folder *AND RENAME IT TO "config.ini"* otherwise you will need to change the code to match the original config name. (Why didn't I do that? Because I don't care enough)
5. Run ``` node app.js ```
6. In your browser go to "http://localhost:3005"
7. Edit your config and save at the bottom when you are done
8. Your new config will be in the same directory, named "new_config.ini"
9. Move to your server directory and rename it to the original config name

# > SUPER MEGA IMPORTANT NOTES
> EVERY. SINGLE. FIELD. MUST. HAVE. SOMETHING. IN. IT. I don't call this hot garbage for no reason. Having a blank field will break the config
> YOU CANNOT USE THE WORD "NONE" IN THE FORM. IT WILL BREAK THE CONFIG
> FOR REGION MAKE SURE YOU USE FULL REGIONS OR WORDS (EX: NORTH AMERICA)
> I HAVE NOT TESTED THE RESULTING CONFIG YET, IT JUST LOOKED RIGHT THAT I COULD TELL.
> FOR ANY BUGS NOT MENTIONED HERE PLEASE OPEN AN ISSUE REPORT VIA GITHUB.
> I HAVE 0 INTENTIONS OF UPDATING THIS OR MAKING IT BETTER
